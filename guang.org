*** [2022-10-26 Mi 15:56]
    I haven't touched this code in a pretty long time, before I can move on,
    I'm going to reorganize it so it conforms to the layout I used in my more
    recent projects, plus the web interface is going to need *a lot* of work.

     The library I use for the SQLite bindings is kind of out of date, I think

     I use a Perl script to roll all of my assets into a Go variable, which
     became unneccessary when Go gained go:embed. Still need to make a few
     adjustments to make that step, then I can remove the script.
