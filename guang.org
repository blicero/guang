** Diary
*** [2022-10-26 Mi 15:56]
    I haven't touched this code in a pretty long time, before I can move on,
    I'm going to reorganize it so it conforms to the layout I used in my more
    recent projects, plus the web interface is going to need *a lot* of work.
** Components
*** Database
**** DONE SQLite
     CLOSED: [2022-10-27 Do 18:36]
     :LOGBOOK:
     CLOCK: [2022-10-27 Do 17:52]--[2022-10-27 Do 18:36] =>  0:44
     :END:
     The library I use for the SQLite bindings is kind of out of date, I think
**** TODO Pool
**** Major cleanup [1/2]                                           :refactor:
     I need to fix/refactor a couple of things.
***** DONE Package
      CLOSED: [2022-10-27 Do 19:45]
      :LOGBOOK:
      CLOCK: [2022-10-27 Do 19:41]--[2022-10-27 Do 19:44] =>  0:03
      :END:
      I need to move the database into a separate package
***** TODO Names
      I need to change a bunch of names.
*** Web interface
**** DONE Embed
     CLOSED: [2022-10-26 Mi 20:42]
     :LOGBOOK:
     CLOCK: [2022-10-26 Mi 16:27]--[2022-10-26 Mi 20:42] =>  4:15
     :END:
     I use a Perl script to roll all of my assets into a Go variable, which
     became unneccessary when Go gained go:embed. Still need to make a few
     adjustments to make that step, then I can remove the script.
*** Refactoring [0/1]                                              :refactor:
**** TODO Packages
     :LOGBOOK:
     CLOCK: [2022-10-29 Sa 18:01]--[2022-10-30 So 00:33] =>  6:32
     CLOCK: [2022-10-27 Do 19:45]--[2022-10-27 Do 20:51] =>  1:06
     :END:
     I need break up the application into more packages, the current state is
     just repulsive from an aesthetic perspective.
