An inverse portscanner

The name is a play on the Kuang ice breaker software used in William Gibson's
1983 novel **Neuromancer**. In the novel, Kuang breaks an artificial
intelligence's IC by sloooowly interfacing with it. Likewise, my
original idea (many years ago) was to write a portscanner that could
go undetected by intrusion detection systems by working very slowly,
scanning only one port a time per host, keeping the results in a
database.
It was how I learned SQL, actually.
